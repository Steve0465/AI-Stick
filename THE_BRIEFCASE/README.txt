3. Start: ./START
4. Pick a number
5. Done

That's AI_STICK in 5 steps.


WHERE ARE THE ACTUAL TOOLS?
────────────────────────────

The Briefcase is just INSTRUCTIONS.

The actual tools are in the main AI_STICK folder:
   - START (the menu)
   - coding_agent.py
   - quick_ai.py
   - windows_rescue/ folder
   - And dozens more

You don't need to know where they are.
Just use ./START and pick from the menu.


WHAT IF I LOSE THIS?
─────────────────────

The Briefcase files are also on GitHub:
https://github.com/Steve0465/AI-Stick

In folder: THE_BRIEFCASE/


WHO IS THIS FOR?
────────────────

Anyone who:
   - Doesn't want to memorize terminal commands
   - Just wants shit to work
   - Needs step-by-step instructions
   - Likes having a reference

That's literally everyone.


ONE LAST THING:
───────────────

If you only remember ONE thing:

   ./START

That command does everything.
Runs the menu.
Everything else is just picking numbers.
